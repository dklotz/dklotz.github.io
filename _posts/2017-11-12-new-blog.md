I finally re-activated my blog (and moved it to a [new domain](https://www.davidklotz.de))! Let's see how often I'll actually get around to writing something, but I convinced myself again that I wanted to have a place where I can put slightly longer notes and thoughts that is completely under my control, because I still [remember websites](http://tttthis.com/rememberwebsites.php/) and don't want to be completely dependent on [Facebook & Co](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people).

I switched from my old wordpress to generating a completely static site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the appropriately named [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
Since I'm lazy, I'm currently hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), where I can just directly push changes to a git repository and have the site automatically rebuilt without needing to set up any custom CI integration for this. But since I'm now generating a static site, moving to a different hosting solution should also be pretty easy if I ever want to do that.

Since you normally can't use SSL and a custom domain for GitHub pages (and I don't want to use a "benevolent MITM" like Cloudflare), SSL is provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) running on my own Server, reverse proxying my GitHub pages subdomain.
